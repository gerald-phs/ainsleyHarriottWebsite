      <h3><span class="threeEmDash">⸻</span> The Man <span class="threeEmDash">⸻</span></h3>
      <p id="tribute-info">
        I love Ainsley so much. He is a fantastic guy: high-spirited, and he reminds me of myself in my younger days. I encourage everyone to maintain this same level of energy and happiness throughout their lives because life, despite its bitter moments, is a wonderful journey, and men like Ainsley remind us all of that beautiful fact. In the picture above, he is just like me, but instead of adding ingredients to an incredible dish in a dazzling display of professional cookery, I'm just a rookie web dev wannabe who struggles to position <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, remember important concepts, and handle math. However, we have something in common: the genuine happiness that comes from absolute immersion in one's profession, with the thought and hope of helping other people, serve amazing food, and create great websites.

      <h3><span class="threeEmDash">⸻</span> The Chef <span class="threeEmDash">⸻</span></h3>
      <p>
        Ainsley is awesome! I think he is the funniest man in the world and the best chef in the world. Here’s some TV stuff he did:
      </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainsley_Harriott">
    Harriott became the resident chef on <b>Good Morning with Anne and Nick</b> and later the main presenter of <b>Can't Cook, Won't Cook</b> and <b>Ready Steady Cook</b>, both shows involving members of the public. He has presented more straightforward how-to-cook programmes such as <b>Ainsley's Barbecue Bible</b>, <b>Ainsley's Meals in Minutes</b>, <b>Ainsley's Big Cook Out</b> and <b>Ainsley's Gourmet Express</b>.

Harriott played the part of a <b>GELF chief</b> in the sci-fi comedy series <b>Red Dwarf</b> in 1993. In 1998, for the show's 10th anniversary, Harriott presented a special edition of <b>Can't Cook, Won't Cook</b> called <b>Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg</b> with the cast of the show cooking a meal while remaining in character.

In 2000, Harriott made his debut on US television with <b>The Ainsley Harriott Show</b>, syndicated by <b>Buena Vista Television</b>, which ran for more than <b>100</b> episodes. Following this he went on to host <b>Ready.. Set... Cook!</b>, the US version of <b>Ready Steady Cook</b>. Ainsley was guest chef on <b>Something for the Weekend</b> on 10 May 2009 and 21 February 2010 alongside guests <b>JLS</b>. In February 2010, Harriott joined the morning show <b>GMTV with Lorraine</b> featuring cookery recipes. From 2002 until 2007, Harriott appeared in TV adverts for <b>Fairy Liquid</b>.

     <div class="pointOfAttention">I may have copied this table from Wikipedia’s entry on Ainsley Harriott, but I've used tables in HTML extensively. To even begin to consider the hypothesis that I might not be solidly aware of HTML syntax is sheer follery: I could write HTML tables underwater with my hands tied behind my back (not very impressive — but the people behind W3C had to start somewhere). Come to think of it, writing my own table here would've been less of a hassle, now that I'm having to clean this up. But I wanted to show Ainsley’s achievements :D</div>
