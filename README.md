# Ainsley Harriott Tribute Website
Tribute webpage for Ainsley Harriott. This was done because I love the guy, and also as a study project for freeCodeCamp.  

I was struggling to center the `<img>` element. It got mixed up with its `<figure>` parent element and everything became so confusing. Eventually, I accidentally added `display: flex;` property to my `<img>` element. Hah! That gave it some **right margin**. From then on, it was just a matter of setting all margins (top, right, bottom and left) to `auto` using the shorthand property `margin: auto;` which successfully centered the `<img>` element in relation to its parent element (and the whole page). Furthermore, because of flexbox, it shrinks and grows as needed.
